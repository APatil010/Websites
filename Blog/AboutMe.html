									<h3>Fun Coder</h3>
									<p> <blockquote>" Every person in this world should know
										how to write a computer program... Because It teaches you how to think."
										<br>--Steve Jobs
									</blockquote> 
									
									Inspired by some of the greatest talents in programming industry,
									"Mark Zuckerberg" , it is kind of something in the blood to write code.

									<h3>Beginner Chef</h3>

									It all started with , Italian product, Pasta. My favourite food anytime,anywhere.
									Cooking is one of those fields which bring peace to the life, cooking your own food

									<h3>Travel Enthusiast</h3>
									<p> <blockquote>
										"Travel is taking a journey into yourself."
									</blockquote> 
									
									Travel is one aspect needed for every human being, it does not only gives you experience
									on travel, but it open a world of thinking and possibilty. You start to imagine things 
									you never dreamt of. You start to meet people, you might have never met in your place.
									Experiencing the different cultures and society in various places was the inspiration here.
